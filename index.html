            <h2>THE GIRL WHO PUSHES TYRA OVER THE EDGE</h2>
<br>
            <p>Be quiet Tiffany. BE QUIET! What is wrong with you? STOP IT!!! I have never in my life yelled at a girl like this! When
            my mother yells like this it's because she loves me.</p>
            <p>I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU, WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU!!! HOW DARE YOU!!! LEARN SOMETHING FROM THIS!</p>
            <p>When you go to bed at night and you lay there and you take responsibility for yourself, 'cause nobody's gonna take
            responsibility for you.</p>
            <p>You're rolling your eyes and you act like this because you've heard it all before, you've heard it
            all before. </p>
            <p>You don't know where the hell I come from, you have no idea what I've been through. But I'm not a victim, I
            grow from it and I learn. Take responsibility for yourself.</p>
