<!-- Cycle IV, Episode VII

THE GIRL 
WHO PUSHES TYRA OVER THE EDGE

Be quiet Tiffany. BE QUIET!
What is wrong with you? STOP
IT!! I have never in my life 
yelled at a girl like this! When
my mother yells like this it's 
because she loves me.

I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU, WE
WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU!!
HOW DARE YOU!! LEARN 
SOMETHING FROM THIS!

When you go to bed at night and
you lay there and you take
responsibility for yourself.
Cause nobody's gonna take
responsibility for you. You 
rolling your eyes and you acting 
like this because you've heard it 
all before, you heard it all 
before. You don't know where
the hell I come from, you have 
no idea what I've been through.
But I'm not a victim, I grow from
it and I learn.
Take responsibility for yourself. -->
